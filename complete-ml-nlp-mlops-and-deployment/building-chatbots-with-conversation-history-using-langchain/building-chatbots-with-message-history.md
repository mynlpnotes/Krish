# Building Chatbots with Message History

* We will be using Groq API here
* Human message means its a user message
* When we send Human message ⇒ LLM will respond with AIMessage
* Runnable means it will help to run in the chain
* BaseChatMessageHistory is abstract class for storing message history
* We can save history in db also, here we are using in memory
* Message History:
  * We can use a Message History class to wrap our model and make it stateful.&#x20;
  * This will keep track of inputs and outputs of the model, and store them in some datastore.
  * Future interactions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input. Let's see how to use this!
  * ChatMessageHistory means a single message
  * BaseChatMessageHistory means entire history
  * Config is for session
