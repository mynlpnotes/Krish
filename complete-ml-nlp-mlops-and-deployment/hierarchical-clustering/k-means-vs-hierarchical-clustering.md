# K Means vs Hierarchical Clustering

K Means:&#x20;

* Can be used for huge dataset
* Can be used for numerical data only
* Elbow method is used, but it can be sometimes dificult to see where there is sudden drop

Hierarchical:&#x20;

* To be used for small dataset - Because here we have to create  dendograms, and if points are more then it wont be able to see split properly
* Can be used for other data also - We can use cosine data also to check the similarity of data points
* While plotting the dendogram we will be using cosine similarity
