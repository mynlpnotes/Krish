# Support Vector Regression

* In SVR also we need to find the best fit line along with the marginal plane, and the distance between them should be maximum
* Cost function will be same as before
* Here constraints will be&#x20;
* Distance between predicted and actual points should be less than epsilon (marginal error) + Error above the margin
* Most points should be covered within our marginal error
* eta will be summation of points above marginal error and margin
* C is also hyper parameter, As C increases loss function decreases,&#x20;
*   &#x20;
