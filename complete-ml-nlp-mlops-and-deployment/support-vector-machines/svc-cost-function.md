# SVC Cost function

* We can also write Max 2 / ||W|| as Min ||W|| / 2
* In ML, we always try to minimize the cost function
* We only need to minimize if classes are clearly separable
* But if there is overlapping then we might need to add some more hyper parameters to the cost function
* Cj = How many points we want to avoid misclassification
* eta = Summation of the distance of the incorrect data points from the marginal plane
* eta is also known as hinge loss
