# Introduction to SVM

* SVR for regression
* SVC for classification
* In logistic regression our aim is to create a line which can separate the classes
* In SVM, specially in SVC also we create a best fit line along with it, we also try to create 2 more lines, which are known as marginal plane
* This marginal should be created such that the distance between the marginal plane is maximum
* Out of the two margins below, we will select left one as d is greater there
* Marginal plane passes through the nearest point of the classes, this are known as support vectors
* In 3D cordinates, we will be create a plane, and it wil 2 marginal planes above and below it
