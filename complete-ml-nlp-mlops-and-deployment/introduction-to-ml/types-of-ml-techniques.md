# Types of ML techniques

1. **Supervised:**

* Suppose the task is to predict house price
* Dataset - Size of the house, No. of rooms, Price
* We divide this features into 2 categories
* Independent features - Size, No. of rooms
* Dependent features - Price
* Regression: Dependent feature will be continuous
* Classification: Dependent feature will be categorical
* if there are only 2 categories then we call it as binary classification
* If there are more than 2 then its multi class classification
* **Algorithm:**
* Linear Regression
* Ridge & Lasso&#x20;
* ElasticNet
* Logistic Regression - Classification
* Decision tree - Both classification and regression
* Random forest - Both classification and regression
* AdaBoost - Both classification and regression
* XGboost - Both classification and regression

2. **Unsupervised:**

* Example: Customer segmentation
* We do not know the output feature
* We dont need to predict
* We need to find the similar group or clusters

3. **Reinforcement:**

* Application will learn by itself by getting rewards
