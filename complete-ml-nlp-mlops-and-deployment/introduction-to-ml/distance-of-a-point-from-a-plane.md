# Distance of a point from a plane

* Lets say we have a plane pi
* If this plane passes through origin then we can use equation wTx = 0, that means w is perpendicular to the plane
* if there is a point S, then how to find the distance(d) of S and plane&#x20;
* Lets consider one more point S'
*

* Since the distance angle between w and d will be less than 90, so d will be +ve
* So for all the points on top of the plane the distance will be +ve
* For S'
* The angle between w and S' the angle will be greater than 90 and less than 270 then we get -ve value
* So for all the points above the plane, the distance between points and plane will be +ve
* And the distance below the plane, will be -ve
* \-ve distance just means that it is on the opposite side of the plane
