# Equation of line, 3d and Hyperplane

* The equation of line is y = mx + c
* m = slope
* slope means that for every unit movement in the x axis what will be change in y axis
* c is intercept
* if x = 0 then where does the straight line meet y, that value will be our c

* If we 3 dimension, then we dont draw a straight line, we will be drawing a 3d plane

* Lets say W and X are our 2 vectors
* If we have a hyperplane then we can geometrically say that W will be a vector that will be parallel to pie
* Below that image is of a 3D plane
* If intercept is 0 then it needs to pass throught origin
