# Simple Linear Regression Introduction

* Dataset:

| Weight -> Input Feature | Height -> Output Feature |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 74                      | 170cm                    |
| 80                      | 180cm                    |
| 75                      | 175.5                    |

* Requirement: Input weight -> Model -> Predict Height

* Whenever we have single input it is called simple linear regression
* If we have multiple inputs, we call it as multiple linear regression
* We will to create a best fit line, this line will help us to do prediction for the new weight
* The distance between true points and predicted points, if we do summation then it should be minimum, that is how we get best fit line
