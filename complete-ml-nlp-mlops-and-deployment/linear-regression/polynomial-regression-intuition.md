* Our data is having non linear relation
* If we try to fit a best fit line then error will be very high
* So here we will be using polynomial linear regression
* &#x20;We need to consider the degree which we will be using for polynomial
* Polynomial with degree 1 is same as simple linear regression
*

* As we increase the degree the line will be able to fit properly
* If we use very high degree then it will start overfitting
