* We are squaring it as we are using Mean squared error
* Our final aim is to minimize the cost function
* We will be changing the values of Θ0 and Θ1 to minimize the cost function

* For now lets consider the intercept Θ0 as 0
* We have a dataset
* Lets initialize Θ1 = 1 -> we find the values of h(x) for different values of x
* This best fit line, will pass all the points
* Lets apply cost function to this, here its 0 as there are no errors
* Not lets consider theta1 as 0.5 and repeat the same procedure
* In this case cost function will be 0.58
* For theta1 as 0, it will be 2.3
* We will also plot Θ1 and J(Θ1)
* Global minima is where we have the least error
