* The equation of line can be written in different manners
* if x = 0, then h(x) = theta0
* Slope basically tells us for every unit change in x axis what is the movement in y axis
* For every new data point, we project x on the straight line and check the corresponding y axis
* y^ is also used as notation for predicted point
* Error is basicall difference between actual and predicted
