# Dockers vs VM

* VM will have hardware, OS kernels and is responsible to communicate with the hardware
* OS like linux also has different flavours
* If we consider docker, it will virtualize application layer
* VM virtualize application layer and OS layer

* Since only application is virtualized in docker so its size is small
* VM size is big coz it will also virtualize OS
* We can install any VM on any OS
* Docker images may have compatibility issue - On a windows machine we cannot install linux docker, however windows 10 and above support linux&#x20;
