# Python Basics - Syntax and Semantics

* Python is case sensitive
* Identation is define block of code - 4 continuous space OR tab required

```python
# Comments
# Single line comment
'''
Multi line comments
'''

# Line continuation
a = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4\
5 + 6

#Geting type of variable
type(a)
# This is called as type inferencing - Python enforces inferecing at run time, so it
# allows dynamic type assignment
```
