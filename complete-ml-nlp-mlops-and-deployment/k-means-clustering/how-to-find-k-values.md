# How to find K values

* WCSS = Within cluster sum of squares
* We will initialize k = 1 to 20
* We will calculate WCSS for each K
* We will plot K value vs WCSS
* This is called as elbow method&#x20;
* We have to point where there is abrupt decrease in WCSS and then its mostly stable
* That point will be selected as K
