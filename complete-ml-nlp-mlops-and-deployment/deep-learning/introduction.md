* AI is to create applications that will be able to perform its own task
* Example: Netflix recommendation, Self driving car, amazon recommendation
* ML is subset of AI and provides stats tools to analyze, visualize and do do forecast and predict
* DL use multi layer neural networks
* DL also has supervised and unsupervised

1. ANN -> Artificial neural network -> To solve classification and regression problems
2. CNN -> Convolution neural network -> Input data will be images and video frames&#x20;
3. RNN -> Recurrent neural network -> Input will be sequential -> NLP and time series
4.
