# Adadelta and RMS Prop

* Here instead of alpha we using new formula here
* We are using exponential weighted average
* Here we are using beta value also for restricting
* Since we are squaring the derivative term, it can become very big also but we are restricting it using beta
* So here are using dynamic learning rate
* Also smoothing concept is also brough here, using exponential weight average&#x20;
