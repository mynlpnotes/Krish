# Chain rule of Derivatives

* In forward propagation we have O1 and O2 as output of the neurons
* To update W4, then derivative will be expanded as
* This splitting of derivates is known as chain rule
* For W1 it will be as below
* O1 is dependent on W1, O2 is dependent on W4, W4 is dependent on O1
