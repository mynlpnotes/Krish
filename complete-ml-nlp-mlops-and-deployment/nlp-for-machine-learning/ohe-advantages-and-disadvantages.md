# OHE Advantages and Disadvantages



| Advantage                                   | Disadvantage                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Easy to implement in python (using sklearn) | <p>Sparse matrix </p><p>if we apply any ML algorithm to sparse matrix then it leads to overfitting</p>          |
|                                             | <p>Variable size representation </p><p>In any ML algo, the lenght of input needs to be fixed</p>                |
|                                             | No semantic meaning is getting captured                                                                         |
|                                             | Out of vocabulary not handled                                                                                   |
|                                             | if vocabulary increases like 50k then it will be more sparse and representation will become even more difficult |
