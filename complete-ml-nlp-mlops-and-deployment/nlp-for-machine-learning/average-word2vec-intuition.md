# Average Word2Vec intuition

* &#x20;In word2vec we take every word and we convert it into vectors
* If we are using google pre-trained word2vec model
* We will get feature representation of 300 dimension for word 'the'
* similarly for every word we will get feature representation of 300 dimension
* If we have so many vector of 300 dimension
* Our aim is to get only 1 vector of 300 dimension -> This will be our input
* So we take average of all this vectors and feed this as input
*
