1. Divide the features into independent and dependent features
2. Train test split
3. Standardize the data
4. Train the model

Check if model is good:

1. If we plot y test vs ypred and if its linear
2. Plot the residuals, it should be almost normal distributed
3. Plot of residuals and predictions should be uniformly distributed, means data should be distributed everywhere equally

```python
```
