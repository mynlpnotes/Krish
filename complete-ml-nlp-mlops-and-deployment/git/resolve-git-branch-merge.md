# Resolve git branch merge

* Many people will be committing to the same repo
* In same file when multiple developers have made changes then there will be a conflict
* When 2nd developer tries to push then he will get error
* So we do below
* git pull
* it will show what changes have been made by other developer
* We will make changes
* After that we can do git add .
* git commit -> git push
