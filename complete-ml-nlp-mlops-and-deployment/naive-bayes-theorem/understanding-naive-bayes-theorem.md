# Understanding Naive Bayes Theorem

* Used to solve binary and multi class classification
* Basic idea about probability is required
* Independent event means one outcome is not hampering or not changing the probability of other outcome
* In dependent event, one outcome is changing the probability of other outcome
* P(B/A) -> Probability of B given A has occured
*   &#x20;

* &#x20;P( A and B) is same as P(B and A)

* &#x20;The algorithm that uses this bayes theorem is called naive bayes algorithm
