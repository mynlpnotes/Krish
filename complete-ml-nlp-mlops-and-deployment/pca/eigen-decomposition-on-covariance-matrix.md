# Eigen Decomposition on Covariance Matrix

&#x20;

* Lets say we have a matrix, and a vector v
* If we apply some linear transformation, then we will be getting a eigen value \* same vector
* Linear transformation, means entire data can be moved in different directions
* From this equation, whichever eigen vector has the maximum magnitude, that will be used as a PC&#x20;

* 1, 1 is vecor here, and we apply linear transformation to it, which will get changed after transformation

* This means if we apply this linear transformation to a vector, then we get 4 and 2 as its eigen value
