# What is Machine Learning

* ML is an application of AI that provides the system the ability to automatically learn and improve experience without being explicitly programmed
* ML focuses on development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves
* The process of learning begins with observation or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instructions, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide
* The primary aim is to allow computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly
