# Supervised Learning

**Supervised Learning:**

* It can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labelled examples to predict future events
* Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values&#x20;
* The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training
* The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct output and find errors in order to modify the model algorithm accordingly

***

**Data and Goal:**

* A set of data records described by k attributes
* Each example is labelled with a pre-defined example
* To learn a classification model from the data that can be used to predict the classes of new cases/instances

***

**Steps:**

* Divide into train and test
* Train using training data test
* Check the accuracy on test data
