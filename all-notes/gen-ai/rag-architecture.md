# RAG Architecture

* &#x20;If chunking is required, then we do it
* We embed and store in vectorDB
* When user asks we dont directly pass it to LLM
* We embed and pass it to vectorDB and retrieve relevant information
* We rank it and then this is passed to LLM and output is generated
* Data collection to storing of embedding data in vectorDB is known as Data Ingestion
* Retrieval is done to provide relevant information to the LLM (Query + Embedding + Similarity search)
