# Working with VectorStore and Retriever

* These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data-- from (vector) databases and other sources-- for integration with LLM workflows.&#x20;
* They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation.

**Document:**

* LangChain implements a Document abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has two attributes:
* page\_content: a string representing the content;
* metadata: a dict containing arbitrary metadata. The metadata attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual Document object often represents a chunk of a larger document

**Retrievers:**

* LangChain VectorStore objects do not subclass Runnable, and so cannot immediately be integrated into LangChain Expression Language chains.
* LangChain Retrievers are Runnables, so they implement a standard set of methods (e.g., synchronous and asynchronous invoke and batch operations) and are designed to be incorporated in LCEL chains.
* We can create a simple version of this ourselves, without subclassing Retriever. If we choose what method we wish to use to retrieve documents, we can create a runnable easily. Below we will build one around the similarity\_search method:



* Vectorstores implement an as\_retriever method that will generate a Retriever, specifically a VectorStoreRetriever.&#x20;
* These retrievers include specific search\_type and search\_kwargs attributes that identify what methods of the underlying vector store to call, and how to parameterize them.&#x20;
