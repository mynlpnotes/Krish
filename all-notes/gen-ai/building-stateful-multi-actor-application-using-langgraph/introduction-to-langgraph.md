# Introduction to LangGraph

Langchain:

* Amazing library ⇒ for component, core, integration
* Very easy to create applications

**Complex workflow:**&#x20;

* LLM calls tools (tools was converted to agents), this is how we did all tasks
* In GenAI we are all able to create message history, RAG, tools, agents
* For complex workflow like Plan a 5 days to paris ⇒ This is a complex workflow
* Day 1 ⇒ Travelling
* Day 2 ⇒ Sighseeing 1, 2
* Day 5 ⇒ Flyback
* Or if we ask Plan a 5 days trip to paris keeping price in mind ⇒ This is more complex workflow
* In such task LLM will be brain and it will try to use different tools to come to decision
* Here state management is also required ⇒ Whatever is planned on day 1, should also be communicated to next day and so on



* Used for building stateful, multi actor application with LLMs
* Agents can also communicate with each other
* Each agent can perform different tasks
* Benefits:
  * Cycle controllability&#x20;
  * Persistence
* It allows to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions.
* Using LangGraph studio we can develop all this workflows using drag and drop
* Using graphDB we can develop graph knowledge
* Graph will be static here
*

**Why LangGraph?**

* Simplifies the development
  * State management of the agent and agent coordination
    * Agent1: Google search
    * Agent2: Wikipedia search
    * Agent3: VectorDB search
    * Chatbot using all this multi AI agents
    * In such application we have to do statement for all the agents and also agent coordination
  * We need to define workflow, logics without worrying about all this
* Flexibility:
  * Flexibility to define own agents logic and communication protocol
  * This allows highly customized application tailored to use case
* Scalability:
  * We can build large scale multi agent applications, which can handle large volume of interaction
* Fault tolerance:
  * Handle errors, Reliability
* Entire workflow is converted into graphs
* Between start to end it is one application and in between we can create any number of nodes
* It shows the flow
* Nodes can be any LLM or function calling it can also be tool calling function
* In graph on the right, when user gives query ⇒ Goes to Node 1 ⇒ Node 1 decides whether to go to Node 2 or Node 3 ⇒ We call this as conditional edges
* Whenever we got from one node to another ⇒ State also changes
