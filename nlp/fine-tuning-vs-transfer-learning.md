# Fine Tuning vs Transfer Learning

#### **Fine-Tuning vs Transfer Learning: Side-by-Side Comparison**

| Feature                                      | **Transfer Learning (Feature Extraction)**                                                   | **Fine-Tuning**                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**                               | Uses a pre-trained model as a fixed feature extractor. Only the last few layers are trained. | A pre-trained model is further trained on new data, with some or all layers updated. |
| **Layers Trained**                           | Only new layers (e.g., classifier on top). The pre-trained model remains frozen.             | Some or all pre-trained layers are updated along with new layers.                    |
| **Computational Cost**                       | Lower, since fewer parameters are trained.                                                   | Higher, as more layers are updated.                                                  |
| **Data Requirement**                         | Works well with small datasets.                                                              | Requires a larger dataset for effective learning.                                    |
| **Flexibility**                              | Limited, as the model only extracts features without modification.                           | More flexible, as the model can adapt better to the new task.                        |
| **Training Time**                            | Faster, since only a few layers are trained.                                                 | Slower, as more layers require optimization.                                         |
| **Similarity to Pre-trained Task**           | Works well even if the new task is different from the original training task.                | Works best when the new task is similar to the original training task.               |
| **Risk of Overfitting**                      | Lower, as fewer parameters are trained.                                                      | Higher, especially with small datasets, since more parameters are tuned.             |
| **Example (BERT for Resume Classification)** | Use BERT embeddings and train a classifier on top (e.g., Logistic Regression, MLP).          | Unfreeze BERT layers and fine-tune on the resume dataset for better adaptation.      |
