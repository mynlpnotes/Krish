# Difference between simple AI assistant and RAG

* We train model on lots of data ⇒ Pretrain ⇒ SFT ⇒ RLFH ⇒ Final LLM
* To this final LLM we are passing prompt and we get output
*

**Problems with LLM:**

* Hallucinations:
  * Output might be wrong
  * Output might be misinformation



* We might have taken internet data but for some specific domain, we might have not trained it
* So for such scenarios there are 2 solutions
  * Retrain the model
  * Use RAG
    * Provide more context to the LLM using few shot learning
