# What is Gen AI

* ML is subset of AI
* DL is subset of ML
* We ML and DL we learned about supervised and unsupervised learning
*

* Gen AI is subset of DL
* LLM model is subset of DL and it also has some properties merged with Gen AI
* DL has Discriminative and generative techniques
*   &#x20;

* Train gen model on huge wikipedia database, then it will be able to answer different questions, sentence completion, it can generate new data itself
* ChatGPT is able to explain based on some input and context
* Discriminative is basically based on supervised, unsupervised and semi supervised
* In Generative we also need reinforcement
* In generative AI, we give unstructured content for training purpose, it tries to see the releation between the distribution of data
* Generative language models - ChatGPT
* Generative image models - Dall E2 - text to image
*

* If the output is number, class, probability, category -> Not GenAI
* If the output is Text, audio, image, video grames -> GenAI



**How ML evolved?**&#x20;

* **ML:** Relationship between features and output variable is learned and the prediction is done
* **DL:** Image classification, Object detection
* **GenAI:**&#x20;
*   &#x20;

* If we give book related to Cat, then GenAI can respond to any questions
